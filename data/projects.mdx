Often the best way to learn new languages or tools is to use them. Following that logic here are some of my more notable projects:

- [Next Invoice](/posts/next-invoice) - An invoicing solution built with NextJS and Stripe.
- [TDU Website](/posts/tdu-website) - My first public project built to spec.
