summary: Quick post describing the upgrades I have done to my 3D printer.

It's been more than a year and a half since I wrote my first post about 3D printing. Since then a lot has happened. For starters like many of the people with 3D printers I was inclined to upgrade in order to get faster and smoother prints rather than the some-what messy original result.

The first upgrade that I made was a BLTouch which allowed me to save time levelling and not have to bother adjusting the printer before every print to make sure it ran perfectly. The other notable upgrades so far have included:

- E3D V6 Volcano
- TMC2130 Silent Stepper Drivers
- New Mks 1.4 Mainboard with more processing power
- Klipper running on my Raspberry Pi to outsource the processing power and kinematic equations
- The Spaghetti Detective (ai assistance in watching the prints for failure)

These upgrades have allowed me to achieve consistent and generally very nice looking prints with minimal effort on my part.

Since these updates I have been running 3D printing and modelling classes at my school for the year 7's who are rivetted to the screen and were super excited to recieve their prints once they were done.
