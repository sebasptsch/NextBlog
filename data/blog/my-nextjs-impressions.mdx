summary: Recently I've been working with NextJS on some projects, here's what I think.

NextJS is the perfect framework for small to medium size apps (provided that you use vercel) as it allows you to create custom API routes that interact with other APIs or even databases without having to deploy a seperate service.

## SSR, ISR and SSG

The other advantage that NextJS has over Gatsby is it's ability to be natively server-side rendered or, if you enable it implement Incremental Server-Side Rendering it makes the ideal blogging platform.

## Authentication

For both of the two projects that I've made with NextJS they've both used next-auth which is a single `yarn add` away and a single config file where you can enable a variety of different OAuth or other authenication options with ease. It makes authentication easy for the uninitiated and has perfect integration with any NextJS adapt.

## Vercel

Vercel is the missing half to NextJS, if you weren't to use vercel to deploy your NextJS projects it would be nigh impossible to get the serverless code to work properly. Though other Static Site Providers provide a similar service because NextJS was made by Vercel it has deep integration that makes it easy to use and write code for.
